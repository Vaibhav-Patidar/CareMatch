Theme: Open Innovation | Domain: Social Impact
Event: Innovate 3.0 – Hack to Build (JIIT Youth Club, JIIT Noida)


<h3>Problem:</h3><br>
Families needing specialised care (disability support, Down syndrome care, recovery assistance, etc.) struggle to find trusted and compatible caregivers.
Existing solutions rely on informal networks or generic listings, offering low relevance, poor trust, and weak compatibility.

<h3>Solution – CareMatch:<br></h3>
CareMatch is an intelligent caregiver–family matching platform that focuses on relevance, trust, and compatibility instead of simple listings.
Families submit structured care requirements, and the system returns a curated list of best-matched caregivers based on skills, experience, and verification.

<h3>Key Features:<br></h3>
Intelligent caregiver–family matching (not a marketplace)<br>
Structured care requirement submission<br>
Skill- and experience-based filtering<br>
Verification-focused caregiver profiles (MVP)<br>
Supports temporary and long-term care needs<br>

<h3>Tech Stack:<br></h3>
Frontend: HTML, CSS<br>
Backend: Python (Flask)<br>
Database: H2 / PostgreSQL<br>
Logic: Rule-based matching engine<br>

<h4>Note:</h4>
The backend is currently implemented in Python (Flask) due to hosting constraints during the hackathon.
The architecture remains flexible for future migration to Java + Spring Boot.

<h3>Impact:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reduces caregiver search time by 40–60%</li>
  <li>Improves caregiver–family compatibility</li>
  <li>Reduces stress for families with complex care needs</li>
  <li>Creates fair opportunities for specialised caregivers</li>
