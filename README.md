https://carematch.onrender.com/

Theme: Open Innovation | Domain: Social Impact
Event: Innovate 3.0 – Hack to Build (JIIT Youth Club, JIIT Noida)


Problem:
Families needing specialised care (disability support, Down syndrome care, recovery assistance, etc.) struggle to find trusted and compatible caregivers.
Existing solutions rely on informal networks or generic listings, offering low relevance, poor trust, and weak compatibility.

Solution – CareMatch:
CareMatch is an intelligent caregiver–family matching platform that focuses on relevance, trust, and compatibility instead of simple listings.
Families submit structured care requirements, and the system returns a curated list of best-matched caregivers based on skills, experience, and verification.

Key Features:
Intelligent caregiver–family matching (not a marketplace)
Structured care requirement submission
Skill- and experience-based filtering
Verification-focused caregiver profiles (MVP)
Supports temporary and long-term care needs

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: H2 / PostgreSQL
Logic: Rule-based matching engine

Note:
The backend is currently implemented in Python (Flask) due to hosting constraints during the hackathon.
The architecture remains flexible for future migration to Java + Spring Boot.

Impact:
Reduces caregiver search time by 40–60%

Improves caregiver–family compatibility

Reduces stress for families with complex care needs

Creates fair opportunities for specialised caregivers

Open Innovation Alignment

Solves a real, underserved social problem

Designed for scalability and collaboration

High social impact with practical feasibility

Adaptable architecture for future integrations (hospitals, NGOs)
